# NEH Grants Data Exploration

## Project Description
This is an exploration of the federal grant data from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).


## Data Source
Grant data from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)
https://catalog.data.gov/organization/neh-gov

Data are in CSV format, one decade per file, covering the period 1967-2021. 
Data sets are in uniformly formatted files with simple CamelCase headings.
Data were retrieved on Oct 16, 2021.


## Primary question 
Who are grants awarded to and in what fields? How do award amounts compare to amounts dispensed, and what factors might impact this result?


## Approach 
Concatenate data from 1970-2021. 

Summarize organization type, award amounts, and disciplines by year; create a suitable visualization. 

Show overall distribution of award amounts by decade. Compare award authorization (outright + match) to amount dispensed (outright + match + supplement); possibly best evaluated as percent of initial authorization due to wide range of dollar amounts. 

What percent of awards are on, below, and above initial authorization? Do these ratios change over time? Where amount dispensed is different from authorization (filter), do they trend with other data within the table (incomplete grant cycle for recent data, poor match generation, or supplemental awards)? 

Communicate results of these explorations with suitable visualizations.


## Additional Comments
This is the final project for the course Foundations of R, administered through the University of Delaware program for Professional and Continuing Studies.
