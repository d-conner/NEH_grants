For this reason, in the 1970s, the state turned to “rehabilitation” of citizens through labor camps, Soviet pedagogy designed to create a “Communist personality in every child” and finally, Fidel’s launch of the Mariel Boatlift in 1980—a policy to rid Cuba of critics accused of lacking “revolutionary genes”. What was it like to grow up in this Cuba? How did leaders go from “teaching the work of the Revolution” to repression and exclusion?  Through unused archives and oral history, I delve into the mechanisms through which grassroots support was constructed and challenged.

Through four intertwined stories about a slave ship and its captives, two West African men, a financier, and a Kongolese prince, it investigates how illegal slavery thrived throughout the Atlantic World in general, and in Brazil in particular, in the very midst of the “Age of Emancipation.” In paying attention to the lived experiences of women, men, and children forced into, or who profited from, illegal slavery, this project challenges the predominant, sweeping narratives of the nineteenth-century as the triumph of abolition, free trade, and liberal freedom. Through an ethnographic reading of the archives of illegal slavery, this project weaves together the past and present, historical characters and archival encounters to propose a new way of writing about the ambiguous histories of slavery and freedom that centers the suffering and afterlives of the enslaved.",Research and writing leading to a book on illegal slavery in the 19th-century Atlantic World.,Latin American History,0,NULL,1,Yuko Miki [Project Director],3,"African History; Interdisciplinary Studies, Other; Latin American History"

My analysis shows how the doctrinal ideal of the disciplined householder as an ascetic-in-the-world provided a basis for treating Brahmin communities as comparable in holiness and authority to monastic orders. This principle justified Brahmins receiving patronage in the form of tax-free endowments and helped secure their families high social status by birth. Over the twelve months of the fellowship, I will finish the research and writing of the last three chapters of the book, which deal with the appropriation and transformation of this normative model on the peripheries beyond the north Indian “middle country”: in the Himalayan hills and Bengal, in the Tamil south, and in Indonesia.","Research and writing leading to a book on the history of Hindu law and the Brahmin class in south and southeast Asia, covering the years 300 BCE to 1000 CE.",History of Religion,0,NULL,1,Timothy Lubin [Project Director],2,History of Religion; South Asian History

I seek NEH funding to write this history, and reveal how presumably separate strands of ethnic and religious migrations in fact intersected. By exploring how competing state and philanthropic institutions sought to limit, channel, and instrumentalize these human migrations for their own purposes, I will recover a history that has often been distorted for ideological and national agendas.

Our solution proposes a workflow that integrates GIS, CAD, and the Unity game engine to build a malleable mapping environment that forgoes the concept of historical layers in favor of linked views that allow simultaneous navigation among original sources, modern cartography, and virtual landscapes. Using work already begun on a 16th-century Portuguese chorography known as the Book of Fortresses as our primary and initial case study, this ”Sandcastle Workflow” proposes a method for confronting a range of pre-modern spatial idiosyncrasies that GIS alone has proven incapable of visualizing.","Designing and implementing new spatial humanities practices to visualize and interpret pre-modern spaces, using the Portuguese text, <em>Livro das Fortalezas</em>, or <em>Book of Fortresses</em>, as a case study.","Interdisciplinary Studies, Other",0,NULL,2,Edward Triplett [Project Director]; Philip Stern [Co Project Director],2,"History, Criticism, and Theory of the Arts; Interdisciplinary Studies, Other"

Based on newly discovered poll lists and using original objects, digital interactives, and physical environments, the exhibition asks what new possibilities the Revolution created for women’s political activism. It explains how hope faltered amid rising partisanship, racism, and class tension as New Jersey closed the vote to all but propertied white men in 1807, yet, also how the Revolutionary promise rose again a generation later as suffragists drew inspiration from these early women voters. Timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the passage of women’s suffrage, the exhibition encourages visitors to consider that progress is not always linear, but that preserving rights and liberties requires constant vigilance.<br />

I offer the first systematic treatment of Suchon’s philosophical system, showing how it offers new, feminist perspective on early modern treatments of human freedom.

From 1864-1871, southern and federal lawmakers and judges, as well as everyday southerners, argued over who ought to be responsible for the financial burden of emancipation. This project explores the little-known history of white southerners’ defense of their perceived right to own slaves or to be reimbursed for their value. Their debates, ranging from former Confederate states to the US Capital, reveal that immediate, uncompensated emancipation in the US South was not an inevitable outcome of Union victory in the Civil War, and the process of emancipation extended well beyond the abolition of slavery.",Research and writing one chapter of a book interrogating the significance of policies governing property rights in slaves before and after Emancipation.,U.S. History,0,NULL,1,Amanda Kleintop [Project Director],3,Legal History; Political History; U.S. History

Using published treatises of political economy, archival petitions to royal and national authorities, judicial records, and newspapers, my book project shows that Hispanic Americans saw money and monetary policy as drivers of economic development and nation building.

It argues that these women should not be evaluated as merely members of an outdated social category waiting to be eliminated but were a key group of controversial women who were often at the center of intense public debates about China’s imperial past and its Republican future. By showing how concubines’ public visibility intricately connected elite men’s private lives to national politics, the book provides new insights on how gender functioned in important yet overlooked ways in the progressive politics of the Republic.","Research

On both fronts, a similar claim is made: namely, that liberal democratic political theory has failed to recognize that human beings are primarily “rationalizing” beings, rather than “reasoning” beings. I believe that political theorists need to take this claim seriously, so that we can consider with fresh eyes the question: to what extent are genuinely “rational” citizens required in order to have a properly functioning liberal democracy?","Writing two to three chapters of a book about the kind of reasoning

of fiction by American writers featured first-person narration—an “I” or a “we”

century, an impersonal or “third-person” style of narration had become the
norm, and the appearance of the first-person “I” was deemed an offensive

as members of a single family allows me to portray these narrative techniques
as a social project, developed among a community of readers and writers, rather

a democratic or private interiority, with the later development of an imperial

At each event, participants will place celebratory narratives of the Civil War and the War on Terror (e.g., memorials, recruitment videos, political speeches, and video games) in dialogue with combatants’ horrific accounts of battle (e.g., photography, poetry, and literature). In our opinion, such juxtaposition highlights and corrects some of the most egregious misbeliefs surrounding the nature of war, misbeliefs that continue to haunt our military veterans.","A year-long public humanities project that would

After they were lost for 600 years, the British Academy (BA) began publishing our editions of Rufus' works, most recently his psychology lectures in 2018. In 2006, the Richard Rufus project (RRP) began publishing critical editions online. In 2020-23 RRP will submit vol. 2 of Rufus' Metaphysics lectures and vol. 1 of his Oxford lectures to the BA and publish online a newly discovered redaction of Averroes' <em>Metaphysics</em> in Latin.&nbsp;","Preparation for print and online publication of a commentary on Aristotle’s metaphysics, redaction of Averroes’ <em>Metaphysics,</em> and the Oxford lectures of Richard Rufus of Cornwall, an early Scholastic philosopher-theologian (ca. 1200-1260).

In such cases, obstetricians had three options: to stand by as both mother and child died; to save the mother by destroying the fetus in utero and delivering it in pieces; or to perform a Caesarean section, which was tantamount to a death sentence for the mother. Thus, medical professionals were forced to weigh the life of the mother against the life of the unborn child, whose value was as yet unknown; and the mother’s own disability was, itself, a factor in this calculus.

This ancient rationale was reversed ca. 1100 when Pope Paschal II exhumed his rival, the antipope Clement III. Soon exhumations were visited upon heretics and excommunicates posthumously condemned, usurers, and even debtors.

Because Jews were distinctive not only in belief and practice, but in kinship ties and occupational patterns, they complicated southern racial and religious norms.

Lucy’s life illuminates important aspects of the Revolutionary-era: a) how the slave trade and enslaved African American labor were instrumental in creating a thriving maritime economy in colonial New England; b) how desire for independence fueled by that economy gave rise to Revolutionary political principles that enslaved people seized upon to obtain their freedom; c) how African Americans struggled to enact those principles as free citizens after the Revolution; and d) how, in this context African Americans expressed their creativity and made important contributions to American culture.","Development

The government used architectural determinism (the belief that the physical structure of the house could restructure the behavior of the residents within) to erase tribal cultures.

People seized by an enemy might be closely confined, subject to interrogation, allowed to wander freely or quickly returned to their countrymen. Colonial officials sometimes kept captives in enemy cities for weeks or months before freeing them to inevitably bring military information to their own lines. Investigating the impact of intelligence-gathering by prisoners reveals networks of information that were inadvertently created by captives and officials on the edges of empire.","Research and writing two chapters for a book on the use

A member of what William Styron once called “the silent generation”—a cohort that also included Truman Capote and Norman Mailer—Matthiessen has not received the same critical attention as many of his peers despite the scope of his achievements. In an extraordinarily diverse career, he wrangled with many of the most critical issues of the last century, from environmental degradation to civil rights. Though a novelist at heart, he wrote one of the earliest works of the modern environmental movement and major examples of advocacy journalism concerning Cesar Chavez and Native Americans. He was also co-founder of The Paris Review while undercover for the CIA. <em>True Nature</em> documents his lifelong journey (his “pilgrimage”) to illustrate the evolution of a sensibility—a kind of ecological consciousness that combined science and spirituality, empiricism and intuition.",A biography of American writer and naturalist Peter Matthiessen (1927–2014).,American Literature,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,American Literature

I use this event to revise the stories we tell about the origins of prison for profit—and subsequently the roots of anti-Black racism. Well-known scholars argue that the American prison industry developed as a Southern effort to re-install slavery after the Civil War. In contrast, I show how the antebellum North originated for-profit convict labor (a fact that previous scholars acknowledge but have not communicated effectively to the public). This fact matters because the Northern mode of convict labor led to distinctive forms of racism: ones based in liberal reform, modern manufacturing, and even abolitionism. By narrating the life of one Black man, his family, and his city, my book restores the antebellum North to the stories we tell about profit-driven incarceration and racism—thus changing what we know about each.","A history of incarceration in Auburn, New York through the story of William Freeman, convicted of a quadruple murder in 1846.",American Studies,0,NULL,1,Robin Bernstein [Project Director],3,African American History; American Studies; Cultural History

Different ways of recording where we come from are layered onto one another. Genealogies capture the priorities of various kinship systems; laws codify privileges and exclusions based on lineage; and today’s sleek DNA kits deliver a record of ancestry anchored in biology, even as their results are interpreted in ways that rest on deep, if not always acknowledged, assumptions about status, race, ethnicity, and nationhood. Ranging from pre-history to the present, my book will describe how ancestry has operated in specific historical contexts, with the goal of explaining why, for whom, and in what ways lineage has been invested with power.","Research and writing of a book on the social, cultural, and political
